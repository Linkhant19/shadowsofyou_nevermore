                            With tears in his eyes<br>
                            Staring at the video game's main screen till dawn,<br> 
                            He promised himself, and said, “Nevermore”

                            And to make a fool of himself to make others laugh,<br>

                            He almost made a scene with a friend who broke promises, <br>
                            but he learned to leave without slamming the door. Nevermore.
